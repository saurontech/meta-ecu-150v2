# ECU-150v2 patches imx8mp-evk.dts heavily (camera/audio/LVDS nodes removed),
# which breaks every downstream NXP EVK overlay/variant DTB that #include's it.
# Drop those variants from the kernel DTB build set so they do not fail compile.
# (The same list also lives in conf/machine/ecu150v2.conf for clarity; we
# repeat it here so the dependency is local to the kernel recipe that owns
# the dts patches.)
